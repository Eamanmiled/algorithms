# Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in different domains such as searching, sorting, and dynamic programming. Each algorithm is placed in its folder and can run independently.

## Contents

- **Binary_Search**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- **Bogo_Sort**: A highly inefficient sorting algorithm, primarily used for educational purposes.
- **Insertion_sort**: A simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **bubble_sort**: A straightforward sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **linear_search**: Implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- **merge_sort**: An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm.
- **sliding_window**: Implementation of sliding window techniques, often used for solving problems involving subarrays.
